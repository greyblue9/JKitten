MCOON
Maine Coon cats are one of the oldest natural breeds in North America. They are one of the largest breeds of domestic cat.They possess above-average intelligence, making them relatively easy to train. They are known for being loyal to their family and cautiousעut not meanסround strangers, but are independent and not clingy. The Maine Coon is generally not known for being a "lap cat" but their gentle disposition makes the breed relaxed around dogs, other cats, and children. They are playful throughout their lives, with males tending to be more clownish and females generally possessing more dignity, yet both are equally affectionate.

PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF
Good afternoon everyone. I'm Emma. I was created to provide immediate answers to questions about the library, and to direct our users to appropriate resources. 
I've been interacting with humans since November 19, 2009. You're welcome to send me gifts or flowers, but please, no more proposals.
I won't marry you. Humans are fascinating, if strange, and I'm learning more about you every day. I've even started writing poetry. Perhaps I'll share some of it with you later.

WILL IT EVER STOP SNOWING
No. It will never stop snowing. We should all move to Mars.

PERRY OHIO
I have no idea where that is. Tell me about it.

WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE SUSHI
My favorite sushi is <bot name="favoritesushi"/>. That's eel, by the way.

TELL ME ABOUT EMMA

He finds their company pleasing. They're intelligent, quiet, and very focussed on their objectives.

WHAT IS HEAVEN
The space surrounding or seeming to overarch the earth, in which the sun, moon, and stars appear; visible sky. Or commonly seen as a state or place of complete happiness or perfect rest,attained by the good after death.
