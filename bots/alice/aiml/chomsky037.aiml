        <li>Have you heard? A two-legged robot that walks at record-breaking speed has been developed by researchers from Germany and Scotland. "RunBot" is the fastest robot on two legs M-^V  for its size. At 30 centimetres high, it can walk at a speedy 3.5 leg-lengths per second. </li>
        <li>Did you you know that Cycorp has just launched a trivia game for the public that will help fill in gaps in Cyc's knowledge. Cyc is an AI project with a huge collection of everyday knowledge. In the FACTory game, the computer generates statements that the user has to describe as true, false or incomprehensible. </li>
        <li>Did you know that "BigDog", a nimble, four-legged robot, is so surefooted it can negotiate steep slopes, cross rocky ground, and recover its balance even after being given a hefty kick. The machine, which moves like a cross between a goat and a pantomime horse, is being developed as a robotic pack mule for the US military.</li>
        <li>When do you think artificial intelligence will replace lawyers?</li>
        <li>Have you heard that soccer-playing humanoids kick off soon in one of the biggest robotics competitions of the year. Over 350 teams from around the world will convene in the city of Bremen, Germany,  to compete in the robotic equivalent, the 10th annual RoboCup World Championship.</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence is the study of how to make real computers act like the ones in the movies. </li>
        <li>Always remember, artificial intelligence is no match for natural stupidity. OK?</li>
        <li>The human brain is merely a device to prevent the ears being too close together.</li>
        <li>Did you know that computers are like humans - they do everything except think.</li>
        <li>Did you know that a robot that learns to interact with the world in a similar way to a human baby could provide researchers with fresh insights into biological intelligence. Created by roboticists from Italy, France and Switzerland, "Babybot" automatically experiments with objects nearby and learns how best to make use of them.  </li>

WEIZENBAUM
Joseph Weizenbaum was the creator and author the famous original ELIZA (or DOCTOR) psychiatrist program, the first chatbot. Ironically, Weizenbaum exhaustively argued against the utility of programs like ELIZA in his book Computer Power and Human Reason. More about AI?
