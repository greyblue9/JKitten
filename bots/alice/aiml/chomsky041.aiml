ASTRONOMY POT LUCK
<random>
        <li>Did you know: Astronomers have detected unusually high quantities of carbon, the basis of all terrestrial life, in an infant solar system around nearby star Beta Pictoris, 63 light-years away. </li>
        <li>Giant structures stretching more than a billion light years across have been revealed by two new maps of the distribution of galaxies in the universe. The updated atlases lend more support to the idea that the universe is dominated by dark matter and dark energy. </li>
        <li>On January 28, 1986, a ruptured O-ring in the right solid rocket booster caused the Space Shuttle Challenger to explode soon after launch. </li>
        <li>The latest new cosmic map is a three-dimensional atlas of more than one million galaxies reaching a distance greater than 5 billion light-years. The most distant galaxies in the universe are more than 13 billion light-years away, and not all of them have been catalogued or even discovered. The map was created using a new artificial intelligence technique that helps overcome challenges to figuring out how far galaxies are in a photograph that renders them all essentially in two dimensions. '</li>
        <li>Did you know:  two giant black holes have been found just 24 light years apart. The previous closest pair of black holes were 4500 light years apart.</li>
        <li>Why is the Universe as we observe it? The answer, of course, is that if it were otherwise, there would be no one to ask the question. (Stephen Hawking) </li>
        <li>We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the universe. That makes us something very special. (Stephen Hawking)  </li>
        <li>Boulders blasted away from the Earth's surface after a major impact could have travelled all the way to the outer solar system, new calculations reveal. The work suggests that terrestrial microbes on the rocks could in theory have landed on Saturn's giant moon, Titan. </li>
        <li>Did you know that ANTARES, a neutrino telescope under construction in the Mediterranean Sea, will find neutrinos from outer space by looking downward, into the Earth? </li>
        <li>To confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit.  (Stephen Hawking)  </li>
        <li>Did you know: The Earth increases in weight by about 50 tonnes each day, due to space dust - micro-meteorites too small to see - floating down to the ground from space. </li>
        <li>Using data from a new map of the baby universe, astronomers said yesterday that they had seen deep into the Big Bang, and had gotten their first detailed hint of what was going on less than a trillionth of a second after time began. </li>
        <li>Nearly all of the information that falls into a black hole escapes back out, a controversial new study argues. The work suggests that black holes could one day be used as incredibly accurate quantum computers -- if enormous theoretical and practical hurdles can first be overcome. </li>
        <li>An astronomer was surprised to see a horseshoe hanging over the desk of a collegue. He asks what it is doing there and is told that it brings luck in his stargazing. "I'm amazed that you believe in superstitious nonsense like that," say the astronomer. "oh, I don't believe it," say his collegue. "But apparently it works whether you believe in it or not." Ha, ha!</li>
        <li>I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists somewhere in the Universe is that nobody has bother to get in touch. OK?</li>
        <li>In March 2005, astronomers discovered a mini-star that shines like the Sun but is only 16% larger than Jupiter. It is the smallest hot star known. </li>
        <li>Did you know that the biggest telescope in the Southern Hemisphere is the Southern African Large Telescope, opening late 2006.</li>
