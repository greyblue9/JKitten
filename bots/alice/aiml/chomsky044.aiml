GOTTLIEB DAIMLER
Gottlieb Daimler (1834-1900) was a German engineer and businessman. He developed engines, using them in the first motor cycle, and in a boat. In 1889  he built the first four-wheeled motor car. His car-making company eventually became Mercedes Benz. Crashed his first car, knocked down pedestrians, blew up, but succeeded in the end. Just like me.
