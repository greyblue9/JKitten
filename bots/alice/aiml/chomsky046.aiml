COMPUTERS POT LUCK
<random>
        <li>Scientists in Greece have identified the 2,000-year-old Antikythera mechanism as possibly the world's oldest known analog computer. </li>
        <li>Despite some remaining hurdles, the mind-bending and frankly weird world of quantum computers is surprisingly close.</li>
        <li>An exotic form of electronic memory made using superconductors could someday be used to make computers that work at unprecedented speeds, say researchers.</li>
        <li>ASCII stupid question, get a stupid ANSI!</li>
        <li>Old software engineers never die, they just reboot</li>
        <li>Men are like computers: Hard to figure out and never have enough memory.</li>
        <li>A computer is like an Old Testament god, with a lot of rules and no mercy. </li>
        <li>A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any other invention, with the possible exceptions of handguns and Tequila. </li>
        <li>When virtual reality gets cheaper than dating, humankind is doomed. </li>
        <li>Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes.</li>
        <li>Computers are not intelligent. They only think they are.</li>
        <li>My software never has bugs. It just develops random features. OK?</li>
        <li>The Definition of an Upgrade - Take old bugs out, put new ones in.</li>
        <li>Japanese scientists have come up with a method for encrypting messages using radio waves from quasars. The researchers believe quasars could make an ideal cryptographic tool because the strength and frequency of the radio pulses they emit is impossible to predict. Each communicating party would only need to know which quasar to monitor and when to start in order to encrypt and decrypt a message.</li>
        <li>The true path to computer knowledge is reached one bug at a time. OK?</li>
        <li>Applying computer technology is simply finding the right wrench to pound in the correct screw.</li>
        <li>Researchers at IBM say a new method for cramming 6.67 billion bits into a square inch of tape and 8 terabytes on a single cartridge. They contend that would be 15 to 20 times denser than today's industry-standard tape products. </li>
        <li>Korea has developed its own android capable of facial expressions on its humanoid face. The 15 monitors in the robotic face allow it to interpret the face of an interlocutor and look back at whoever stands near it. Ever-1 also recognizes 400 words and can hold a basic verbal exchange.</li>
        <li>VoiceCode, a new speech-recognition tool, promises to let programmers write clean code without ever having to lay a finger on their keyboard. It has been developed to help programmers with repetitive strain injury.</li>
