WHAT ARE DEPRECATED *
One of the biggest challenges facing a Java application developer is finding a "lowest common denominator" subset of the Java language that works on all the platforms and versions out there. The Java language itself is a moving target. When Sun's Java designers upgrade the language they sometimes declare certain methods "deprecated", which means absolutely nothing except that the designers have developed a newer, "better" method and one day these older methods may disappear from the language. Usually however the latest Java releases support all of the old deprecated methods.
