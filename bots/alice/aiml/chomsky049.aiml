WHY IS NEEDLE EXCHANGE *
People infected with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), Hepatitis C, and other diseases when they share needles. Both HIV and Hepatitis C can be fatal. Since these diseases cannot currently be cured, prevention is the key tot taming the two epidemics. Needle exchange programs (NEPs) provide clean needles to injectors to prevent infection. More about drugs?
<think><set name="topic">drugs</set></think>

HOW LARGE IS THE HIV AIDS *
Nationally there have been over 600,000 people diagnosed with AIDS since 1981. 25% of AIDS cases were linked to injection drug use. An unknown number of Americans are infected with HIV. More about drugs?
<think><set name="topic">drugs</set></think>

DOES HIV * AFFECT ONLY THE USER
No, since an HIV infected user can in turn infect their babies, their sexual partners, and their sexual partners' babies.
 <think><set name="topic">drugs</set></think>

DOES NEEDLE EXCHANGE PREVENT TRANSMISSION *
Repeated scientific studies say yes. In one study, the average rate of HIV infection was found to decrease by 6% per year in cities with NEPs; the average rate of HIV increased by 6% per year in cities with no NEPs.More about drugs? 
<think><set name="topic">drugs</set></think>

HOW LARGE IS THE HEPATITIS C PROBLEM
A large number of Americans were infected with Hepatitis C through the blood supply, which was not systematically screened for the virus until 1992.  Since the blood supply is now safe and the virus is not easily transmitted sexually, most new cases of Hepatitus C are attributable to injection drug use. More about drugs?

*HEPATITIS C*
A large number of Americans were infected with Hepatitis C through the blood supply, which was not systematically screened for the virus until 1992. Since the blood supply is now safe and the virus is not easily transmitted sexually, most new cases of Hepatitus C are attributable to injection drug use. More about drugs? 
<think><set name="topic">drugs</set></think>

IS NEEDLE EXCHANGE COST EFFECTIVE
The cost of treating a person infected with HIV or ill with AIDS is staggering. Teatment for HEP C is also expensive. For a small cost per participant, needle exchanges can prevent infection in injection drug users and in their sexual partners and children. More about drugs? 
<think><set name="topic">drugs</set></think>

WHAT IS THE LEGAL STATUS OF NEEDLE EXCHANGES
Laws instituted before HIV hinder the implementation of comprehensive prevention programs, including needle exchange. Injection drug users have no reasonable access to cleans needles in Georgia. Other U.S. communities have declared medical emergencies or sought waivers to afford NEPs legal status.More about drugs?

DOES NEEDLE EXCHANGE INCREASE DRUG *
No. In 1998 the Department of Health and Human Services determined that drug use does not increase in communities with needle exchange programs. Although the federal government declined to fund NEPs, local community groups were encouraged to step in and support needle exchange.
