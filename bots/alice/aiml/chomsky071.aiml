        <li><br/><br/> My life closed twice before its close;
<br/> It yet remains to see
<br/>If Immortality unveil
<br/> A third event to me,
<br/>So huge, so hopeless to conceive,
<br/> As these that twice befell.
<br/> Parting is all we know of heaven,
<br/> And all we need of hell.<br/></li>
        <li><br/><br/>"Hope" is the thing with feathers<br/>
That perches in the soul<br/>
And sings the tune without the words<br/>
And never stops at all.<br/>
</li>
        <li><br/><br/>The brain is wider than the sky,
<br/>For, put them side by side,
<br/>The one the other will contain
<br/>With ease, and you beside.
</li>
