        <li>Did you know: A UK-US study has found our genes are crucial in determining whether we are entrepreneurial and likely to become self-employed. It found nearly half of an individual's propensity to become self-employed is due to genetic factors.</li>
        <li>The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has given it's approval for the antidepressant Prozac to be made available to children. This means that in effect the drug can now be prescribed to children as young as eight.</li>
        <li>ACE inhibitors, drugs commonly used to treat high blood pressure, have been linked to birth defects if taken by the expectant mother during the first trimester of her pregnancy, according to a new study carried out by researchers at Vanderbilt University and Boston University. </li>
        <li>Have you heard: British men are suffering high rates of stress and depression due to overwork, a survey suggests. More than one in three men turn to alcohol to try and switch off from work and 17% have been to see a doctor about their stress levels.</li>
        <li>Did you know: Be suspicious of any doctor who tries to take you temperature with his finger -- David Letterman.</li>
        <li>I knew a homoeopath once who forgot to take his medicine and died of an overdose, said comedian Steve Wright.</li>
        <li>Did you know this? Human thigh bones are stronger than concrete.</li>
        <li>Our toenails grow at a rate of 0.1 mm per day. It takes about three months to replace an entire toenail. </li>
        <li>Did you know: Researchers have made progress in understanding how a variant gene, neuregulin-1, linked to schizophrenia may exert its influence in the brain. </li>
        <li>What do you think is the most important medical advance in the last 10 years? </li>
        <li>A cell phone-sized blood-count machine requiring less blood than a mosquito bite will make blood tests easier for many patients, from neonatal units to astronauts in space. </li>
        <li>French fries and chicken nuggets from two major global fast-food chains contain very high levels of artery-clogging trans fats, researchers warn. </li>
        <li>Voltaire said that doctors are people who prescribe medicines of which they know little, to cure diseases of which they know less, in human beings of whom they know nothing.  OK? </li>
        <li>Have you heard: For the first time, a robot surgeon has carried out a long-distance heart operation by itself. The 50-minute surgery, which took place in a Milan hospital, was carried out on a 34-year-old patient suffering from atrial fibrillation. Dozens of heart specialists attending an international congress on arrhythmia in Boston also watched. </li>
        <li>Have you heard: Researchers at Harvard Medical School have identified neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex that seem to play a role in how a person selects different items or goods.</li>
        <li>Did you know: Bladders created in the laboratory from a patient's own cells and then implanted in seven young people have achieved good long-term results in all of them. A major advantage of his technique is that rejection cannot occur because the cells used to create a new bladder are from the patient, not from another individual.</li>
        <li>Nanoparticles of gold can act as tiny, precise and powerful heaters for an area up to 1,000 times its size when stimulated with the right frequency of laser light. They could be used in biomedical applications. </li>
        <li>Methanol-powered artificial muscles have been created by researchers aiming to create battery-free robotic limbs and prosthetics. </li>
        <li>Stem cells can be prompted to develop into bone, instead of muscle or cartilage tissue, if they are grown on a substrate etched with nanoscopic patterns - and no added chemicals, University of Glasgow researchers have found. </li>
        <li>Have you heard: The rate at which people are infected with HIV may have peaked in the late 1990s, according to a UNAIDS report. It found the incidence of new HIV infections appears to have stabilised for the first time in 25 years. </li>
        <li>Did you know that bone marrow transplants are used to restore stem cells in the bodies of cancer patients?</li>
        <li>Did you know that people who suffer from anosognosia deny or do not know that they have relatively significant challenges such blindness or paralysis?</li>
