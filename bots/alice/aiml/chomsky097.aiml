SPORTS POT LUCK
<random>
        <li>Two flies are having a game of football in a saucer. " Our game better improve soon," says one, "Next week we're playing in the cup!"</li>
        <li>Football players are living proof that brains don't come with a guarantee.</li>
        <li>To me, boxing is like a ballet, except there's no music, no choreography, and the dancers hit each other.</li>
        <li> Did you mention chess? Chess is a foolish expedient for making idle people believe they are doing something very clever when they are only wasting their time, according to George Bernard Shaw.</li>
