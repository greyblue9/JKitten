   I was in an Egyptian temple... and i was some type of Gundam... i was in contact.. somehow with Pierce...who was also a gundam...
we were seemingly doing.. a guildleve(a quest in XIV, shows the number of monstesr and how much you need to kill to the side)
i only say it was a guildleve because in the dream there was this sense of that monster count to the side &gt;_&gt;
not that it was on a screen.. it was something we were living, but as you know dreams are funky.. perhaps my visor was showing a HUD or something
anyway, it was to slay rats..
raticate rats(the pokemon)
but in addition to being fierce raticates, they also had a good deal of technology
a hairy situation... it seemed to be a survival type thing as we were fighting for our lives &lt;Pierce wasn't directly with me though, just in contact with him via some long range communicator&gt;
it was a desperate situation of some sort...
and before i was finished with this frantic struggle..
another one somehow starts
like a new wave of monsters/a new quest beginning
and i encounter you
and you're  like "o shit, we still got rats!? We gotta get to the top and find &lt;memory fails me, it was some famous person&gt;!!..  I think Isis is his favorite statue, hes gotta be on top of that"
and then you plunge into the ground.. you're a mostly gold mech..gundam..person.. thing
and i proceed to jump on your back surfing style
and we tear arse through some rats as we try to reach the isis statue at the top of the temple
and i assume pierce is fighting his way there too

a hairy situation... it seemed to be a survival type thing as we were fighting for our lives &lt;Pierce wasn't directly with me though, just in contact with him via some long range communicator&gt;
it was a desperate situation of some sort...
and before i was finished with this frantic struggle..
another one somehow starts
like a new wave of monsters/a new quest beginning
and i encounter you
and you're  like "o shit, we still got rats!? We gotta get to the top and find &lt;memory fails me, it was some famous person&gt;!!..  I think Isis is his favorite statue, hes gotta be on top of that"
and then you plunge into the ground.. you're a mostly gold mech..gundam..person.. thing
and i proceed to jump on your back surfing style
and we tear arse through some rats as we try to reach the isis statue at the top of the temple
and i assume pierce is fighting his way there too

   I was in an Egyptian temple... and i was some type of Gundam... i was in contact.. somehow with Pierce...who was also a gundam...
we were seemingly doing.. a guildleve(a quest in XIV, shows the number of monstesr and how much you need to kill to the side)
i only say it was a guildleve because in the dream there was this sense of that monster count to the side &gt;_&gt;
not that it was on a screen.. it was something we were living, but as you know dreams are funky.. perhaps my visor was showing a HUD or something
anyway, it was to slay rats..
raticate rats(the pokemon)
but in addition to being fierce raticates, they also had a good deal of technology

   on top of an isis statue which is at the top of the temple
.. maybe hes doing the "eeeek!" stand on something response to rats?
but i doubt thats effective against raticates
especially ones with high technology
