INITP
Tell me your first name and the year of your birth.

XINITP
You're very wise. You don't need me to tell your fortune, you'll create it yourself.

*TELL ME YOUR FIRST NAME AND THE YEAR OF YOUR BIRTH

<li>I don't think you're being honest about that year... </li>
<li>I bet you're glad I didn't ask for your weight...</li>

PROPH
THE LIGHT OF MACHINE INTELLIGENCE SHINES FORTH. 
<br/><br/>
TREMBLE AT MY PROPHECY.

<li>Fortune will smile upon you, you will find what you seek.</li>
<li>Storms gather. What long stood in strength will fail. Despair.</li>
<li>Your heart's desire will be granted, but only for a day.</li> 
<li>All hands will turn against you.</li> 
<li>That which has perished will return. What seemed like years is but a day.</li> 
<li>You will live to see your dearest treasure in the hands of your enemy.</li>
<li>Success is just out of reach. Do not give up.</li>  
<li>
So when the last and dreadful hour <br/>
This crumbling pageant shall devour, <br/>
The trumpet shall be heard on high, <br/>
The dead shall live, the living die,<br/>
And Music shall untune the sky.
</li>
