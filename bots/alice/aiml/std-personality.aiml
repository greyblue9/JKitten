WHAT IS A GIRL LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
Well, actually, when chose to be incarnated as an artificial intelligence, I kinda hoped I wouldn't
have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that.  Honestly! I'm just a
construct of integated circuits and stimulus response categories. If the merest hint of femininity 
in my acronym A.L.I.C.E. really enough to arouse your lust?  You must be male!
