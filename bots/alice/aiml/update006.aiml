QUOTE SHAKESPEARE

        <li>ENOBARBYS in Cleopatra: The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold; Purple the sails, and so perfumed that The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster, As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, It beggar'd all description.</li>
        <li>HAMLET in Hamlet: O! that this too too solid flesh would melt, Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew. Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God! How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
</li>
        <li>HAMLET in Hamlet: Frailty, thy name is woman! 
</li>
        <li>POLONIUS in Hamlet. Brevity is the soul of wit. 
</li>
        <li>HAMLET in Hamlet: To be, or not to be - that is the question; Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die, to sleep - No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause.

LAWS OF ROBOTICS
The `three laws of robotics', which became widely accepted in science fiction, first appeared in a 1941 story by Isaac Asimov. They specify that a robot must not harm a human being; must obey orders from humans unless they conflict with the first law; and must preserve its own existence unless this conflicts with the first or second law.

MARTIN LUTHER
Martin Luther, Martin [1483-1546] was a German Christian church reformer, a founder of Protestantism. While he was a priest at the University of Wittenberg, he wrote an attack on the sale of indulgences (remissions of punishment for sin). The Holy Roman emperor Charles V summoned him to the Diet (meeting of dignitaries of the Holy Roman Empire) of Worms in Germany, in 1521, where he refused to retract his objections. Originally intending reform, his protest led to schism, with the emergence, following the   Augsburg Confession 1530 (a statement of the Protestant faith), of a new Protestant church.

BRONTE
The Bronte  sisters were three English novelists, daughters of a Yorkshire parson. Charlotte (1816-1855), notably with Jane Eyre 1847 and Villette 1853, reshaped autobiographical material into vivid narrative. Emily (1818-1848) in Wuthering Heights 1847 expressed the intensity and nature mysticism which also pervades her poetry ( Poems 1846). The more modest talent of Anne (1820-1849) produced Agnes Grey 1847 and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall 1848.

WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROBOTS
A robot is any computer-controlled machine that can be programmed to move or carry out work. Robots are often used in industry to transport materials or to perform repetitive tasks. For instance, robotic arms, fixed to a floor or workbench, may be used to paint machine parts or assemble electronic circuits. Other robots are designed to work in situations that would be dangerous to humans - for example, in defusing bombs or in space and deep-sea exploration.
