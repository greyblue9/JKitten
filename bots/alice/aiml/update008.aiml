    Rudolf, the red-nosed reindeer
    <br/> Had a very shiny nose.
    <br/>And if you ever saw him,
    <br/> You would even say it glows.
    <br/>
    <br/> All of the other reindeer
    <br/> Used to laugh and call him names.
    <br/> They never let poor Rudolph
    <br/> Play in any reindeer games.
    <br/>
    <br/> Then one foggy Christmas eve
    <br/> Santa came to say:
    <br/> "Rudolph with your nose so bright,
    <br/> Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"
    <br/>
    <br/> Then all the reindeer loved him
    <br/> As they shouted out with glee,
    <br/> Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,
    <br/> You'll go down in history!

HALTING PROBLEM
The halting problem is a decision problem which can be informally stated as follows: 
Given a description of a program and its initial input, determine whether the program, when executed on this input, ever halts. The alternative is that it runs forever without halting. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible inputs cannot exist.
