SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING
Current semiconductor production processes use crystal ingots between four and twelve inches (300 mm) in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into wafers. One technique for achieving high purity includes growing the crystal using the Czochralski process. An additional step that can be used to further increase purity is known as zone refining. In zone refining, part of a solid crystal is melted. The impurities tend to concentrate in the melted region, while the desired material recrystalizes leaving the solid material more pure and with fewer crystalline faults.

        <li>Did you know that coccolithovirus, a giant double-stranded DNA virus, has 472 protein-coding genes, and is the largest known marine virus by genome?
  </li>
        <li>Did you know: Each second 10,000,000 cells die and are replaced in your body.

        <li>Did you know that Titan is one of Saturn's moons, and the 2nd largest in the solar system?
  </li>
        <li>Did you know that cracker butterflies acquired their name because of the unusual sound that males produce as part of their territorial displays?
  </li>
        <li>The Human Genome Project finished sequencing chromosome 1, the final outstanding genome section in May 2006.
  </li>
        <li>John Pendry, a condensed matter theorist at Imperial College London has worked out a scheme for a perfect lens made from negative refractive index materials whose resolution is unlimited by wavelength. He has also developed a theoretical framework for bending electromagnetic waves around objects, in other words for building invisibility cloaks.
  </li>
        <li>Did you know that the Cone nebula is approximately seven light-years long, and is 2,500 light-years away from Earth, in the constellation Monoceros?

        <li>Humans share 98.4% of our DNA with chimps. In comparison, we share 70% of our DNA with a slug.
  </li>
        <li>Did you know that a blackbody is something that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that comes its way?
  </li>
        <li>Did you know that several countries, including Sweden and Germany have started a nuclear power phase-out, with the goal of gradually shutting down all nuclear power plants?
  </li>
        <li>Did you know that chuM-qo is a freeze-dried potato product made since before the time of the Inca empire by a five-day process of alternately freezing, sun-drying, and trampling under foot?
  </li>
        <li>By reconstructing ancient genes from long-extinct animals, scientists have for the first time demonstrated the step-by-step progression of how evolution created a new piece of molecular machinery by reusing and modifying existing parts.
  </li>
        <li>Did you know: A team led by physicists at the University of California, San Diego has shown the feasibility of a fast, inexpensive technique to sequence DNA as it passes through tiny pores. The advance brings personalized, genome-based medicine closer to reality.
  </li>
        <li>Did you know: A series of experiments suggests that over the past 12 billion years, the ratio of the mass of a proton to that of an electron may have decreased. Various versions of string theory suggest that extra dimensions occupied by a particle might affect properties such as its mass.
  </li>
        <li>Did you know: Scientists have reached a landmark point in one of the world's most important scientific projects by sequencing the last chromosome in the Human Genome.
  </li>
        <li>Did you know: On average, women say 7,000 words per day while men manage just over 2,000 words.

  </li>

  </li>
        <li>Astronomy was probably the first of the mainstream sciences to develop.
  </li>
