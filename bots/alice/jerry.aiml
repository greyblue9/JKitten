   SOMETHING THAT GETS ME THOUGH

   WHEN I HAVE A SUBTASK AT PRIORITY 8
  </pattern>
  <template>
   Back
  </template>

 <category>
  <pattern>
   AND THE ROOT TASK IS PRIORITY 5
  </pattern>

   Back
  </template>

 <category>
  <pattern>
   THE ROOT IS MARKED UP HIGHER
  </pattern>

  <pattern>
   WHICH IS GOOD
  </pattern>
  <template>

   BUT IT DOESN'T MOVE UP WITH THE OTHER ROOTS OF THAT RANK
  </pattern>
  <template>
   Back
  </template>

 <category>
  <pattern>
   IT ASSUMES 8, BUT ITS STILL BELOW THE 6'S ON THE SCREEN

   AND BY NO MEANS DO I MEAN TO GIVE YOU A "TO DO LIST"
  </pattern>
  <template>
   Back
  </template>
 </category>
 <category>
  <pattern>
   BUT I THINK THE SUBTASK WITH THE EARLIEST DUE DATE SHOULD CREATE THE DUE DATE FOR THE ROOT TASK IF THE USER DOESN'T ASSIGN A DATE TO THE ROOT
  </pattern>
  <template>
   Back
  </template>
 </category>
 <category>
  <pattern>
   AND EVEN THEN MAYBE THE SUB SHOULD TRUMP THE ROOT, IF THE SUB IS SOONER

   What's the reasoning behind sunday being 2 days
  </template>
 </category>
 <category>
  <pattern>
   WHAT'S THE REASONING BEHIND SUNDAY BEING 2 DAYS
  </pattern>
  <template>
   Well, i mean, it goes "due now", due in 1 day, due in 2 days

 </category>
 <category>
  <pattern>
   I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CALCULATE IT
  </pattern>
